##Current Status
The initial version of TaskManager is live and has been successfully utilized by the me and my friends for managing tasks and share it. However, development has been paused with the intention to completely redo the project using advanced technologies and incorporating enhanced features. This decision stems from the desire to provide a more flexible and robust task management system, capable of accommodating a wider range of user needs and preferences.
